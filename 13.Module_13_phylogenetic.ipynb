    "Phylogenetics is the study of evolutionary relationships among biological entities – often species, individuals or genes (which may be referred to as taxa). The major elements of phylogenetics are summarised in figure below.\n",

    "Phylogenetic trees based on whole genome data tell us about the relationships of bacterial isolates to each other on a very fine scale. When we combine that high-resolution information about the evolutionary relationships of isolates with geographical data it can inform our understanding of the current distribution of the pathogen and allow us to infer the epidemiological processes that have acted on the bacteria over time. The simplest example of this would be if a phylogeny showed that a pathogen was geographically constrained (e.g. isolates from the same region always cluster together). This might indicate that the pathogen is not rapidly spreading. Whereas a pathogen with a phylogeny that shows isolates from distant regions are likely to be related to isolates from nearby, the interpretation is that the pathogen is likely to be spread across regional borders. Geographical referencing of genomic data can also be combined with temporal information to study the movement of pathogens in space and time. This is most useful when done in real time and thus can be useful for outbreak detection and monitoring.\n",

    "## Part 2: Identifying recombination using Gubbins\n",
    "\n",
    "Many bacteria participate in high rates of homologous recombination. This means that they donate and receive segments of DNA from each other. In the context of a phylogenetic tree, in which we are comparing similar and dissimilar regions to determine relatedness of isolates this can prove problematic resulting in branch lengths which reflect recombinations rather than divergence. This is very important for *Streptococcus pneumoniae* which is naturally competent, meaning it can readily take up DNA. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Gubbins](https://github.com/nickjcroucher/gubbins/blob/master/docs/gubbins_manual.md) (Genealogies Unbiased By recomBinations In Nucleotide Sequences) is an algorithm that iteratively identifies loci containing elevated densities of base substitutions while concurrently constructing a phylogeny based on the putative point mutations outside of these regions. Simulations demonstrate the algorithm generates highly accurate reconstructions under realistic models of short-term diversification of sequences through both point mutation and recombination, and can be run on alignments of many hundreds of bacterial genome sequences. It is therefore not appropriate for looking at recombination across species-wide diversity - this can be done gene-by-gene using software such as fastGEAR. Instead, it works on samples of limited diversity, sharing a recent common ancestor - a strain or lineage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The required input file for Gubbins is a whole genome FASTA alignment. Each sequence should have a unique identifier, and special characters should be avoided. The sequences should only use the characters ACGT (DNA bases),N (unknown base) or - (alignment gap). If a starting tree is to be included, then this should be a Newick format.The alignment is most easily generated through mapping sequences against a reference sequence. This can be achieved with the popular mapping software Snippy. \n",
