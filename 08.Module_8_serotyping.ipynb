    "\n",
    "Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. It provides the ability to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container. Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so you do not need to rely on what is currently installed on the host; i.e., it involves bundling an application together with all of the necessary configuration files, libraries, and dependencies to ensure the software can run in a reproducible fashion across a diversity of computing environments. You can easily share containers while you work, and be sure that everyone you share with gets the same container that works in the same way.\n",

    "\n",
    "To date, there are >100 known serotypes described for *S. pneumoniae* based on differing biochemical and antigenic properties of the capsule. There are a number of in-silico methods to detect the cps locus, which can then be used to predict serotypes from WGS data. Accurate identification of pneumococcal serotypes is important for tracking the distribution and evolution of serotypes following the introduction of effective vaccines.\n",
    "\n",
    "[SeroBA](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/seroba?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) was developed and it makes efficient use of computational resources in addition to accurately detecting the cps locus at low coverage, and it predict serotypes from WGS data using a database adapted from PneumoCaT. SeroBA can predict serotypes, by identifying the cps locus, directly from raw whole genome sequencing read data with 98% concordance using a k-mer based method, can process 10,000 samples in just over 1 day using a standard server and can call serotypes at a coverage as low as 10x. SeroBA is implemented in Python3 and is freely available under an open source GPLv3.\n",
